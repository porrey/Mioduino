The Mioduino is based on the Arduino bootloader-programmed chip (Atmega328P) from AdaFruit.

This is a preprogrammed Atmega328P chip, useful if you want to make your own Arduino-compatible or repair a damaged chip on an exisiting Arduino UNO, Duemilanove, Diecimila, or NG!

This chip is programmed with 'ADAboot', AdaFruit's version of the bootloader that is "quick-start" NG/diecimila/duemilanove/UNO-compatible. This means that there is still a 5-second delay from when you press the reset button to when the Arduino runs the sketch but that after you upload a new sketch it will begin immediately. This makes the debugging process much faster!
